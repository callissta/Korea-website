    <br>
    <p>As everyone knows, Esepcially K-POP fans, South korea is often considered one of the most beautiful countries in Asia. It is a highly developed and modern country with many stunning places to visit, Such as 
        <strong>Jeju Island, Gyeongju, Chunwang Peak, and Namsan Tower</strong> Not to mention the vibrant city of SEOUL at night.</p>
    <br><br>

    <p>In Korea the colour RED symbolises death, and red pen is used to record the names of people who have passed. This had led to a huge taboo around writing a living person's name in red pen it's seen as the equivalent of putting a curse on them or wishing for them to die.

    <br>
